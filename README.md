# Maya Dead Cells - 3D Model
## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project consists of creating a 3D model of the main character from the game Dead Cells using Autodesk Maya. The goal was to recreate the game's aesthetic in a three-dimensional environment while respecting its artistic style and original design. This was my first big project using maya!
